# Deliveries cohort

Code used to generate a deliveries cohort in HES. See the included readme file for more details. Based on [Ireland et al. IJPDS;2024;9:2:04](https://ijpds.org/article/view/2404/).

Code lists are mainly from the ECHILD Phenotype Code List Repository (https://code.echild.ac.uk) as documented in the guidance.
